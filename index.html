									<h2>In a nutshell</h2>
									<p>Persevering and being passionate about achieving the best result are just as important to me as motivating my fellow human beings.<br />
									I am currently working as a software developer in the retail industry, developing a Data Hub system using cutting-edge approaches.<br />
									Looking for part-time work in machine learning or software development in another industry such as finance, biotech, or technology in general.

								<h2>Deep Dive</h2>
								<p>
									I started working in the automation and logistics industry at the age of 16. I was fascinated by supply chain issues, how globalisation works and how it will affect our lives in the future. After graduating from vocational school with a degree in logistics, I decided to deepen my knowledge in this field and completed a professional bachelor's degree in industrial engineering and international logistics. I find it exciting to design, control and optimise processes economically. I learned how to strive for energy-efficient processes by analysing and continuously improving them in order to increase efficiency and minimise costs. My thesis was on a management concept for a food tech company based in Switzerland with sites across Europe. I am currently working as a software developer for a retail company. The integration of IT and data science into a company is necessary for its continued existence. For this reason, I decided to study Data Science, first on a self-study programme and then part-time. I am looking forward to a great future in technologically advanced companies all over the world.
